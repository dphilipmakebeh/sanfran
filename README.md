PROJECT: MISSION
San Fran is a brainchild of Sang pour Sang MBOA. The mission is to resurrect, financially, a two-star Hotel in Cameroon called San Francisco.
Our (in this case the staff at PFFEINSAA) deal with the Hotel is to bring in Entertaining activities that will interest people to come to the
premises for fun events and free-willed expense.

PROJECT: ABOUT US
San Fran is a budding project that was piloted on November 11th 2023. This time we are thinking even bigger, even better and alot more open minded than are few years ago.
This project calls for alot of creative thinking, cutting down losses, team building, fast forward thinking, and hardwork (ofcourse). 

PROJECT: STRATEGY
We need a digital system that can keep the currency of the project easily tokenizable. An Android CApp (Centralized Application) will be built to manage
logistics, information automation, modernisation, security, and more.

An online presence on relevant social media where our target clientelle is hosted. Digital Marketing (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc) pointing to our e-store 
and WhatsApp Business to get closer to customers.

CONCLUSION
If you would like to embark on a journey of social-capitalism i.e capitalism for social development including a nice package of equity shares based on PoUW (Proof of Useful Work); then please join us here:-
